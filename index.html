        <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
        <p>I am a novice web-designer. I love to create things from crocheting to making makeshift cardboard fortes on my veranda. I remember once on valentines day  in first-grade I made handmade cards with little inscriptions for everyone in my class ;unfortunately they didn't have candy attached to them so they weren't well received . From a very young age I understood the empowerment  that comes with  creating something with nothing. </p>
        <p>I have a belief that learning how to code will help me make more of my ideas a reality. I want to create the best body of work I can and also later to be able to contribute to the  programming community.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want become adept in building web pages through four major languages:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to use my knowledge to gain some short-term income as a freelance web-designer. In the future I want to leverage those experiences to build my own personal sites and applications that will help people. In addition to, creating a passive income for myself.</p>
