        <h2>Make It Stick</h2>
        <p>This is an awesome explanation of how best to learn new material. They talk a lot about what methods are proven to work. They even break it down to examples and support it with real life studies. If you ever felt lost on how to approach learning something difficult, this book would be a great read.</p>

        <h2>No Excuses</h2>
        <p> Brain Tracy the author, has been around  for a while in the self-help/self improvement world. I have only read this one book from him but I plan on reading others later. Its a easy read or listen if you prefer audio books. What I like about this book is that his advice is timeless and your read other books in the field you can see parallels. This book is more of a doing book so I would say it's best read to read it in sections and the methods on improvements incorporated slowly.</p>

        <h2>Outliers</h2>
        <p>The author is half Jamaican as told through his a little story of his mother as a outlier towards the end of the book. Although this is a small mention and is over shadowed by the sheer novel* of this book  it still lead me to have a even stronger infinity for this book. It totally changed my outlook on success and what it really is through the lense of statistical outlier. I highly recommend this book it's an awesome read.</p>
